# Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation
This repository focuses on solving programming tasks from the "Introduction to Theory of Computation" course, which covered topics such as automata theory, formal grammars, Chomsky hierarchy, and complexity classes. I developed implementations for various automata and parsing algorithms as part of the lab assignments.
