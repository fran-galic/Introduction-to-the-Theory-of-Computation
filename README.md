# Introduction to Theory of Computation - Lab Assignments

This repository contains the programming tasks I completed as part of the "Introduction to Theory of Computation" course. Throughout the course, I gained a deep understanding of formal models of automata and grammars, essential for describing, defining, and verifying the behavior of computational and communication processes, protocols, and systems.

## Course Overview

The course introduces formal models of automata and grammars to describe, define, and verify the correctness of computational and communication processes. It explains fundamental properties of systems such as determinism, decidability, computability, complexity, and efficiency. The focus is on automata theory, formal grammars, and the Chomsky hierarchy, including:

- Regular, context-free, context-sensitive, recursive, and recursively enumerable languages.
- Complexity classes and their hierarchies: P, NP, complete and hard problems, and reduction procedures.

## What I Learned

By completing this course, I learned to:

- Describe the behavior of computational systems and communication protocols using formal languages.
- Design computational processes using formal models like finite automata and pushdown automata.
- Apply formal models to verify the validity and correctness of systems.
- Classify problems according to the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages.
- Choose the optimal complexity model for system design and development.
- Evaluate the time and space complexity of computational processes.
- Assess the efficiency of communication protocols and systems.
- Determine the complexity class of given problems.

## Lab Assignments

The lab assignments focus on:

- Implementing finite automata and minimization algorithms.
- Working with pushdown automata.
- Parsing techniques using recursive descent.

Each task required practical implementation and submission for automated evaluation through a web application.
